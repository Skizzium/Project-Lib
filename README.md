### This project is staled indefinitely.
### This is because itÂ will not be used as much as I would like to and just requires too much work to be supported.
### I might, however, continue working on it in the future once I have more time and I'm not working on 3 projects at once.

As the name implies, this is a library providing a lot of boss utilities so developers can do less coding. It allows for boss battle music (synchronized in the future), more customizable boss bars, minions, staging system and boss spawning (similarly to the Wither).

This library is mainly utilized and developed for Skizzik & Co. but it will have some additional features that I might not need in that mod.

If you're struggling with the library's usage, please refer to the Wiki page.
For any other issues, please open a new issue in the Issues tab.
